# Load Board ðŸš›ðŸ“¦

Take coding challenge. Goal of the app is to create a single page app tha allows users to view all loads/shipments. 
If the shipment is unlocked, users will be able to update the shipment status (booked/available). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Pull the repo down to your local
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DeltaV93/mastery-code-challenge.git
$ cd mastery-code-challenge
```

Run the client app
```
$ cd client
$ npm i && npm start
``` 

Run the server app
```
$ cd server
$ npm i && npm start
``` 

You will be able to view the app on http://localhost:3000

##### Note: If you have something running on port:3000, the app will run on another port. Check your server terminal to find what port the app is running on.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
npm 5.2+
```

### Project Built With
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Styled-Components
- Semantic UI
- Loadash

### Available Scripts - ðŸ“‚Client

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Next Steps

* Do additional research/ask more questions to understand what is needed on this page.
* Add a search bar so people can quickly find what they are looking for 
* Add testing using Jest
* Change the `Can Edit Status` label styling for better UX
    - right now the labels look like buttons you can click on. Better design will fix this.
* Change the `Status: (booked/available)` label styling for better UX
    - when you hover over them the cursor looks like you can click on it. This needs some UX help because it should just be an indicator      
* Add messaging to the app
    - When a user updates the status, you should get a banner that alerts the user their changes have been updated
